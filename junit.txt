|Q1| Relation between the Unit Test & Regression Testing?
	How Unit test helps to reduce effort in regreession testing?
		Hence what is unit testing ? 
			What is TDD?

Ans   * Developer focus on unit testing every chunk of the code they develop.
	* we know that testing should go parallelly with each passing phase of the SDLC.
	* Starting from requirement and analysis to design & development till maintenance
	* Reducing the Effort of Regression testing.
			
    UNIT Testing -* testing of small logic of code to verify that the output of the code  is an excepted on the input 
			  of a satisfying certain condition.
			* it provide insight into how current code impact future implementation

|Q2|   What is Test Coverage?

Ans	* The percentage of code that is tested by Unit Tests is called Test Coverage.
	* Having the high test coverage of your code allows you to continue developing a feature
		without having to perform a lot of manual test.

|Q3|   How much Test coverage is Essential?

Ans   * Efficient Test need not 100% test Coverage or Incorporating automation tests
	* " according to me unit test for every single path or branch coverage "

      * There is no much hard & Fast rule to how much test coverage is essential,
	it is all judgemental, the judgemental get better with experience on the application workflow and
	 historic knowledge of the defects so far.

|Q4|   Relation between the Junit and Unit Test ?

Ans   Framework that is used for writing and executing test case in Java Programming Language.
	It is one of the best knowing Unit Testing Framework.

|Q5| What are Automation Tool For Unit Testing ?

Ans Unit_Testing = { Junit, Nunit ,Embunit, TestNg, HtmlUnit } 

|Q6| Junit 4 vs Junit 5 annotation

	| Junit 4 annotation  |  Junit 5 Annotation |
